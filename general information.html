    <li id="top">Kingdom: Animalia --- Multicellular, eukaryotic organisms
    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="top">Phylum: Chordatan  ---  Animals that have a notochord, a hollow dorsal nerve cord, an endostyle or thyroid, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail at some point during their larval or adult stages
    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="top">Class: Mammalia  ---   Vertebrate animals that characterised by the presence of milk-producing mammary glands for feeding their young, a broad neocortex region of the brain, fur or hair, and three middle ear bones
    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="top">Order: Carnivora  ---  Placental mammals specialized primarily in eating flesh
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    <li id="top">Genus: Canis  ---  Species of this genus (eg. wolves, dogs, coyotes, and golden jackal) are characterized by moderate to large size, their massive, well-developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails

<div class="body">
Gray wolf is the largest wild extant member of the Canidae(dog) family. Compared to other Canis species, it has less pointed ears and snout, a shorter torso, larger legs, and larger feet. The fur color of gray wolves is usually mottled gray, but it can also be pure white or black.
