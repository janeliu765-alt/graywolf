    <h4>Visual sense</h4>
</div>
    <div class="body">
Gray wolves possess special eye structure and high concentration of rod photoreceptor cells, giving them excellent night vision.
    </div>
    <div class="xs标题">
    <h4>Auditory sense</h4>
</div>
    <div class="body">
Gray wolves are not only able to hear sounds from a long distance, but can also precisely locate the sound source because their ears can rotate independently. Additionally, their ears help regulate body temperature, so wolves living in warmer areas tend to have larger ears.
    </div>
    <div class="xs标题">
    <h4>Olfactory sense</h4>
</div>
    <div class="body">
Gray wolves have an incredible sense of smell that allows them to detect scents from up to 3 miles away. They can derive much information from the smell, such as the species and health condition of the prey, and use the scent to track it.
    </div>

    <div class="小标题">
    <h3>Paws</h3>
</div>
    <div class="body">
Gray wolves have large paws that prevent them from sinking into the snow while chasing prey; while most of their prey, like ungulates, tend to sink.
    </div>

    <div class="小标题">
<h3>Fur</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="body">
 Their thick fur can keep them warm in cold conditions. The coat is also waterproof, which allows them to swim across rivers and streams.
